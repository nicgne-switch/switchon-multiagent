## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Layer (Lovable)

The frontend layer provides the user interface for SaaS founders and team members to interact with the platform.

- **Onboarding Interface**: Conversational UI for data collection
- **Strategy Dashboard**: Visualization of AI-generated strategies
- **Content Editor**: Interface for reviewing and editing AI-generated content
- **Approval Workflows**: UI for approving actions and campaigns
- **Performance Dashboards**: Visual representation of KPIs and metrics

### 2. Backend Services

The backend services handle the business logic and orchestration of the platform.

- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **Strategy Service**: Handles strategy generation and management
- **Content Service**: Manages content generation and templates
- **Workflow Service**: Coordinates execution of approved actions
- **Integration Service**: Manages connections to external systems

### 3. Database Layer (Supabase)

Supabase provides the data persistence layer for the platform.

- **User Data**: Authentication and user profiles
- **Company Data**: SaaS startup information and configurations
- **Strategy Data**: Generated strategies and their versions
- **Content Library**: Templates and generated content
- **Performance Data**: Metrics and KPIs for analysis

### 4. AI Agent System (OpenAI)

The AI agent system is the core intelligence of the platform, powered by OpenAI.

- **Strategy Architect Agent**: Generates comprehensive GTM strategies
- **Lead Qualifier Agent**: Evaluates and scores potential leads
- **Outreach Creator Agent**: Generates personalized outreach content
- **Campaign Optimizer Agent**: Analyzes performance and suggests improvements
- **Agent Coordinator**: Orchestrates interactions between agents

### 5. Workflow Automation (n8n)

n8n provides the workflow automation capabilities of the platform.

- **Strategy Workflows**: Automate strategy generation and updates
- **Content Workflows**: Automate content creation and distribution
- **Action Workflows**: Execute approved marketing and sales actions
- **Integration Workflows**: Connect with external systems and tools
- **Analytics Workflows**: Calculate and update performance metrics

### 6. Analytics Engine

The analytics engine processes and analyzes performance data.

- **Data Collection**: Gathers performance metrics from various sources
- **Data Processing**: Processes raw data into meaningful insights
- **Reporting Engine**: Generates performance reports
- **Optimization Engine**: Identifies opportunities for improvement
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Manages and analyzes test results

## Data Flow

1. **Onboarding Flow**:
   - User inputs data via Lovable frontend
   - Data is validated and stored in Supabase
   - Initial configuration is created for the SaaS startup

2. **Strategy Generation Flow**:
   - Strategy Architect Agent retrieves company data from Supabase
   - Agent generates strategy based on company profile
   - Strategy is stored in Supabase
   - User is notified for approval via Lovable

3. **Content Generation Flow**:
   - Outreach Creator Agent retrieves strategy from Supabase
   - Agent generates content aligned with strategy
   - Content is stored in Supabase
   - User reviews and approves content via Lovable

4. **Execution Flow**:
   - Approved actions trigger n8n workflows
   - Workflows execute actions across channels
   - Results are captured and stored in Supabase
   - Performance metrics are updated

5. **Optimization Flow**:
   - Campaign Optimizer Agent analyzes performance data
   - Agent generates optimization recommendations
   - Recommendations are presented to user via Lovable
   - Approved optimizations update strategy and content

## Integration Points

### External Integrations

- **CRM Systems**: Bidirectional data sync for lead and customer information
- **Email Platforms**: Execution of email campaigns
