# SwitchON MultiAgent - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
SwitchON is an AI-powered multi-agent platform designed to automate and optimize the entire B2B sales and marketing process for SaaS startups. The platform covers the complete journey from onboarding, strategy generation, tactical execution, to performance optimization through a conversational and visual interface.

## Vision & Purpose
The platform enables SaaS founders to build and execute revenue-generating strategies by simply answering a few smart questions. The system then:
- Builds a revenue-backed Go-To-Market strategy
- Designs and launches campaigns automatically
- Assigns actions to human or AI SDRs
- Tracks conversion metrics in real-time
- Continuously tests and improves tactics using AI

This represents autonomous revenue orchestration rather than simple automation.
