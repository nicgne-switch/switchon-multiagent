# Development Environment Setup

## Overview
This document outlines the development environment setup for the SwitchON MultiAgent platform, including all required technologies, dependencies, and configuration steps.

## Technologies

### 1. Frontend (Lovable)
Lovable will be used for the user interface and onboarding flow. Since Lovable is a third-party service, we'll simulate its integration in our development environment.

### 2. Backend (Node.js)
The backend services will be built using Node.js with Express for API development.

### 3. Database (Supabase)
Supabase will be used for data storage, authentication, and real-time capabilities.

### 4. Workflow Automation (n8n)
n8n will handle workflow automation and integration with external services.

### 5. AI Services (OpenAI)
OpenAI's APIs will power the AI agents for strategy generation, content creation, and optimization.
